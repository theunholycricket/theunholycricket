<p>MY LOVE DRIPS IN RED OUT OF MY MIND AT THE EDGE OF THE SKY</p>

<p>LAST NIGHT IM MESSING UP NOW I FEEL LIKE DRESSING UP</p>

<p>ALL OF THIS TURBULENCE WASN’T FORECASTED</p>

<p>IF THIS ICE SHOULD BREAK IT WOULD BE MY MISTAKE</p>

<p>USED TO BE ONE OF THE ROTTEN ONES AND I LIKED YOU FOR THAT</p>

<p>DRIFTING IN AND OUT WE’RE UP AND DOWN ON LUCK</p>

<p>CURSE WORDS AND EMPTY CUPS CRACKED BLACKTOP CURLING UP</p>

<p>They take the simple things inside you and put nightmares in your hands</p>

<p>ITS ALLLLL IN THE GROOOOVE</p><p>

WE DONT TALK ENOUGH WE SHOULD OPEN UP</p>

<p>GET DRESSED TO UNDRESS DEPRESS TO IMPRESS ALL NIGHT LONG</p>

<p>But then if you’re so smart, tell me why are you still so afraid?</p><p>

HEY DAY DREAMER I THINK YOU’RE THINKING TOO MUCH</p>

<p>Summers end around the bend just flyin’, swimming suits are on the line just dryin’</p>

<p>Somewhere in these eyes I’m on your side</p>

<p>OH BABY MAYBE ITS 1974…</p><p>

MAKING A MESS AIN’T AS FUN AS IT USED TO BE</p>

<p>IM MELTING EVERYHTING IS SO SURREAL</p>

<p>ITS JUST YOU AND ME IN THE SUMMERTIME</p>

<p>I'll take care of you, if you ask me to, in a year or two</p>

<p>The feelings here, the pattern caught in a falling tear</p>

<p>You don’t need no ticket boy it’ll take you when its time</p>

<p>How did I go from growing up to breaking down</p>

<p>Wish we’d grown up on the same advice and our time was right</p>

<p>When you find out what you want, you’re gonna miss this when its gone</p>

<p>For you I’d bleed myself dry</p>

<p>We’re just two slow dancers last ones out</p>

<p>It's always "what if?" and "why not?" Man you gotta just be<br>
Simplify define your goals and watch them grow <br>
Be your own true self the you that I know</p>

<p>Dirty knees an honey bees nowhere else could sting this sweet</p>

<p>I don’t wanna swim forever I don’t wanna fight the tide</p>

<p>Passing out pieces of me, don’t you know nothing comes free</p>

<p>I'm jealous of the way you’re happy without me</p>

<p>You will grow too quick, then you will get over it</p>

<p>Silly little girl she tries, thinking she is good and wise</p>

<p>I'M NEVER COOKING UP WHAT YOUR CRAVING</p>

<p>FEEL THIS BURNING LOVE OF MINE</p>

<p>I’LL TAKE CARE OF YOU, IF YOU ASK ME TOO</p>

<p>FUCK IT YOU SAID ITS BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE THE END<br>
SO SICK OF SWIMMING IM IN OVER MY HEAD</p>

<p>HOME IS WHEREVER IM WITH YOU</p>

<p>The branches of the trees they will hang lower now</p>

<p>IM SPENDING LIKE HALF OF MY SUMMER TRYNA HOLD ON YOUR HAND</p>

<p>PLEASE HURRY LEAVE ME I CANT BREATHE PLEASE DONT SAY YOU LOVE ME</p>

<p>NOTHING IN THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME BUT MY LOVE IS MINE ALL MINE</p>

<p>I KINDA LIKE YOUR TRICKS TWO LIZARDS ON A STICK AN ESTUARY DIG</p>

<p>I GOT THIS HABIT, DUMB FIXATION, I GO BACK AND RELIVE EVERY CONVERSATION </p>

<p>TAKING HITS FOR YOU CAUSE I WANNA FEEL LIKE IM SUPPOSED TO</p>

<p>ITS ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN LOVE YOU LIKE OXYGEN I DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY OR DO</p>

<p>CAN THE KILLER IN ME TAME THE FIGHTER IN YOU?</p>

<p>I DONT KNOW HOW TO FEEL BUT I WANNA TRY</p>

<p>I was dreaming; I was thinking; Maybe you could stay<br>
I was hoping for a moment; your mind might change</p>

<p>WE HAD OUR OWN KIND OF ENERGY FUNNY WHEN YOURE RIGHT THERE NEXT TO ME TROUBLE WILL FIND US <br>
BUT NOW ITS BEHIND US</p>

<p>
YOU ATE ME RIGHT UP YOU SPIT ME BACK OUT <br>
YOU BIT MY HEAD RIGHT OFF WITH YOUR TINY LITTLE MOUTH<br>
I LICKED THE BLOOD FROM YOUR LIPS</p>

<p>I DONT KNOW HOW YOU GET OVER GET OVER SOMEONE AS DANGER TAINTED AND FLAWED AS YOU</p>

<p>Fallin down, from high hopes to the ground, there’s no way out</p>

<p>DID I DRIVE YOU AWAY</p>

<p>IM ADJACENT TO A LOT OF LOVE</p>

<p>YOU'VE BEEN LOCKED IN HERE FOREVER AND YOU JUST CANT SAY GOODBYE</p>

<p>I DONT WANNA END THE SEASON ON A BAD EPISODE</p>

<p>YOU NEVER SAW MY BIRTHMARK</p>

<p>But we don't have to talk about it<br>
I can walk you home and practice method acting</p>

<p>I wanna be your vacuum cleaner<br>
Breathing in your dust</p>

<p>And I asked, "Are you ready? Ready for this life?</p>

<p>In or out, you go. In your silence, your soul</p>

<p> OH, MY GOD, TAKE ME BACK THE WAY THAT I WAS </p>

<p> What do you do with the pieces of a broken heart?<br>
And how does a man like me remain in the light </br>
And if life is really as short as they say, then why is the night so long?</p>

<p> tempers astray, just like a dog, rabid for days, lost in the fog</p>

<p> YOU LOOK LIKE YOUVE BEEN FOR BREAKFAST AT THE HEARTBREAK HOTEL </p>
