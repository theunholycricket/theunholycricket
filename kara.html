<p> Kara is a girl and she is a very hard worker and ensure that shit gets done. She was the president (of a student consulting org) but was overthrown. She is fine with this though, as she now is all to pursue various hobbies such as sleeping, playing silly games, blow drying her hair, browsing stores, and completing 1000 piece puzzles. In soon months she will move to the big city with a big girl corporate job and begin the "puzzling" journey that is post-grad adulthood. 
<p>
Here is what Kara has to say about her life:
<P>


"Can you believe the plot twist in my life lately? I went from being the president of our student consulting org, calling the shots, to getting dethroned. But here's the kicker – I'm oddly thrilled about it.
<p>
Now, picture this: I've become a maestro in the art of relaxation. I'm a professional sleeper, a gaming guru, and I've elevated blow-drying my hair to a daily performance. Add to that my impressive talent for casually strolling through stores with zero shopping agenda – it's practically an Olympic sport.
<p>
But that's not all. I've also taken up a part-time gig as a university golf club restaurant server. Why? Well, I'm saving up for the grand move to the big city. Because let's face it, pursuing your corporate dreams requires a little financial cushion. So here I am, serving up dishes with a side of determination, all in the pursuit of my post-grad adventure.
<P>
And let's not forget the puzzles. I'm the reigning champion of 1000-piece masterpieces. It's like my brain decided to take a detour to Puzzleland, and I'm soaking up every witty twist.
<p>
In a few months, I'm diving headfirst into the big city with a big girl corporate job. The real-world puzzle awaits, and I'm ready for the challenge. Life's too short not to enjoy the journey, and right now, I'm savoring every unexpected turn in this post-grad adventure. Here's to the hustle, the puzzles, and the paycheck!"

<P>
- Kara
