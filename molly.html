<p> Molly is a girl and she resides in Massachusetts during school months emerging from the blazing heats of Arizona. 
<p>
Here is what Molly has to say about her life:
<P>
"
Well, hey there, party people! Molly in the house, or should I say, the city skyscraper circus! I've gone from wrangling tumbleweeds to juggling city dreams, and guess what? Graduation is knocking on my door like a persistent pizza delivery guy.
<p>
So, here I am, a bewildered graduate with a degree in silliness and a major in romance. Spent the past four years in the land of lobsters and clam chowder, but now it's decision time – stay in this city of dreams or go chase waterfalls, Portland-style. Spoiler alert: I already spent last summer in Portland, because who can resist those quirky vibes and endless coffee shops? Not this girl!
<p>
Now, about the love quest in Beantown – it's like a rom-com with more glitter and less cowboy hats. I've got my eyes peeled for a partner in crime who can handle my silly dance moves and maybe even teach me the art of synchronized skipping. Boston, you better be ready for this level of romantic absurdity!
<p>
In my small-town days, love was simpler than a game of tag, but now I'm in a city where romance is a spontaneous flash mob waiting to happen. Imagine me, the city silly queen, twirling through the streets in the latest fashion trends, leaving a trail of laughter and confetti behind.
<p>
As I juggle choices like a clown on a unicycle, I'm armed with my wit, charm, and a wardrobe that's more dazzling than a disco ball at midnight. Life's too short to be serious, so I'm turning every decision into a sitcom episode with a laugh track and a sprinkle of Portland weirdness.
<p>
Here's to the silliness, the laughter, and the love stories written in neon lights across the city skyline. Boston, Portland, and everywhere in between – brace yourselves for Molly's whirlwind of romance, laughter, and downright silliness!"
<p>
